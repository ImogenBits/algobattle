        Incrementally try to search for the highest n for which the solver is
        still able to solve instances.  The base increment value is multiplied
        with the power of iterations since the last unsolvable instance to the
        given exponent.
        Only once the solver fails after the multiplier is reset, it counts as
        failed. Since this would heavily favour probabilistic algorithms (That
        may have only failed by chance and are able to solve a certain instance
        size on a second try), we cap the maximum solution size by the first
        value that an algorithm has failed on.

        ----------
        matchup: Matchup
